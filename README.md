# micro-lc notification center

</div>

This [micro-lc][micro-lc] plugin enables you to handle notifications in your application.

[micro-lc]: https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc

## run locally

If you'd like to test this notification center on your local machine, after install all needed packages via `yarn`,
you'll find a tiny backend notification server which handles you some data to start your component visualization mode. Such backend can be started by using

```shell
yarn start:be
```

[Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) provides a simple frontend server which serves a simple html page containing a navbar + this repo's `micro-lc-notification-center`.
To open just run

```shell
yarn start
```

and, if not automatically prompted, navigate to <http://localhost:3333>
